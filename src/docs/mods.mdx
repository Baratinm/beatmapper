There are a lot of really cool mods for Beat Saber, and I'm starting to add limited support for some of them to Beatmapper. So far, only custom colors is supported, though I'm planning on adding support for others soon.

### Custom colors

The [`SongCore`](https://github.com/Kylemc1413/SongCore) mod allows maps to customize 5 color values:

- The left-hand saber _(default: red)_
- The right-hand saber _(default: blue)_
- The first lighting color _(default: red)_
- The second lighting color _(default: blue)_
- The obstacle color _(default: red)_

You can now overwrite those values in the "Map Settings" tab. Tick the "Enable custom colors" checkbox to show the controls for these 5 values.

> For users who haven't installed the SongCore mod, your map will still load and be playable, it just won't respect the custom colors you've assigned.
