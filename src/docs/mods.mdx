There are a lot of really cool mods for Beat Saber, and I'm starting to add limited support for some of them to Beatmapper.

Additional mod support coming soon.

### Custom colors

The [`SongCore`](https://github.com/Kylemc1413/SongCore) mod allows maps to customize 5 color values:

- The left-hand saber _(default: red)_
- The right-hand saber _(default: blue)_
- The first lighting color _(default: red)_
- The second lighting color _(default: blue)_
- The obstacle color _(default: red)_

You can now overwrite those values in the "Map Settings" tab. Tick the "Enable custom colors" checkbox to show the controls for these 5 values.

> For users who haven't installed the SongCore mod, your map will still load and be playable, it just won't respect the custom colors you've assigned.

### Mapping Extensions

The [Mapping Extensions](https://github.com/Kylemc1413/MappingExtensions) mod grants incredible power to the modder, allowing them to place notes outside the bounds of the typical 4×3 grid.

Beatmapper approaches this mod in a bit of an unconventional way. Rather than simply letting you place notes outside the 4×3 grid, it allows you to _redefine the grid_. Maybe you want a section of the song to be in a 5×4 grid, or maybe you want to squeeze an extra column in between all the normal ones, for a 7×3 grid in the space of a 4×3 one.

To use Mapping Extensions, first you have to enable it for your map in the "Map Settings" tab.

> Note: Ticking this box will mean that only users who have Mapping Extensions enabled will be able to play your map. Many users, especially on the Quest, will not be able to load it.

Once Mapping Extensions has been enabled for your map, a new button appears in the Notes view's right-hand sidebar: `Customize Grid`.

Clicking this button opens a modal that allows you to customize the number of rows and columns in the grid. You can also change the width and height of each cell, so that a larger number of columns doesn't need to take up more physical space in the world!

> Changing the grid doesn't affect notes you've already placed. This means that different sections of your map can use different grids!

There's much to be done in this arena - stay tuned for additional tweaks and quality-of-life improvements!
